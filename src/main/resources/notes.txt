The file EarningsCall.wav is from the OpenAI tutorial on using the Whisper model to transcribe text from audio.

See https://platform.openai.com/docs/tutorials/meeting-minutes for details.

The file AssertJExceptions.wav was exported from Descript from a YouTube short I created on the topic. See https://www.youtube.com/shorts/JUZjnkpYPgY for details.
