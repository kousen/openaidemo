The file EarningsCall.wav is from the OpenAI tutorial on using the Whisper model to transcribe text from audio.

See https://platform.openai.com/docs/tutorials/meeting-minutes for details.

(Looks like it's too long to be uploaded programmatically. Sigh. It should probably be split into multiple smaller files, but that's likely more trouble than it's worth.)

The file AssertJExceptions.wav was exported from Descript from a YouTube short I created on the topic. See https://www.youtube.com/shorts/JUZjnkpYPgY for details.
